## What is the Resources folder?

The Resources folder is a folder containing resources for the Chess4Everyone website. 

This folder mostly contains basic HTML files which can be copied to another directory and modified in said directory. It saves us a lot of time and effort. No need to code an HTML file from scratch-just copy to another directory, edit it, and publish. Isn't that easy?
